Containers are usually stateless and fault tolerant, and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances are a great match for powering your Amazon EC2 compute for these workloads. In this workshop, you learn how to provision, manage, and maintain your Amazon Kubernetes clusters with Amazon EKS at any scale on Spot Instances to architect for optimizations on cost and scale. We dive deep using hands-on material to provision and scale worker nodes, handle interruptions, and design for fault tolerance.
