# Installing Applications with Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that packages multiple Kubernetes resources into a single logical deployment unit called **Chart**.

In this chapter, we'll cover [installing Helm](helm_intro).  Once installed, we'll demonstrate how Helm can be used to [deploy a simple NGINX webserver](helm_nginx), and our more [sophisticated microservices](helm_micro) example.
